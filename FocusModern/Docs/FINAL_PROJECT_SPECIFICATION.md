## Implementation Specifications

### 1. Windows Desktop Application
- **Framework**: C# Windows Forms with .NET Framework 4.8
- **UI**: Native Windows Forms controls with modern styling
- **Database**: SQLite with System.Data.SQLite (one per branch)
- **Storage**: Windows AppData directory for data files
- **Printing**: Windows native printing API + Crystal Reports for A4
- **Deployment**: Single EXE file with embedded dependencies

### 2. Branch Management System
```
Application Structure:
FOCUS Modern
├── Login Screen
├── Branch Selection (1, 2, 3)
├── Main Application (per selected branch)
└── Branch Switching (without restart)

Each Branch Contains:
- Separate SQLite database
- Independent customer/vehicle/loan data
- Separate document storage
- Branch-specific reports and backups
```

### 3. Database Structure (Per Branch)
```sql
-- Single SQLite file per branch: focus_branch{1|2|3}.db

-- Core tables remain the same as specified earlier
customers, vehicles, loans, transactions, system_config

-- Branch-specific configuration
CREATE TABLE branch_info (
    branch_number INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_name TEXT,
    address TEXT,
    last_voucher_number INTEGER,
    created_date DATE
);
```

### 4. Data Migration Approach (Per Branch)
```
Legacy Migration:
Old/1/ → focus_branch1.db
Old/2/ → focus_branch2.db  
Old/3/ → focus_branch3.db

Process:
1. Extract data from each Old/{n}/ directory
2. Create separate SQLite database for each
3. Migrate branch-specific data independently
4. Validate each branch separately
5. No cross-branch data mixing
```

## Migration Process

### Step-by-Step Migration
1. **Install Application**
   - Run FOCUS-Modern-Setup.exe
   - Choose installation directory
   - Create desktop shortcuts

2. **Branch 1 Migration** (Active Data)
   - Copy Old/1/ directory to migration folder
   - Run migration tool for Branch 1
   - Validate migrated data
   - Generate comparison reports

3. **Branch 2 & 3 Migration** (Historical Data)
   - Repeat process for each branch
   - Maintain separate validation
   - Preserve historical integrity

4. **Final Verification**
   - Compare legacy reports with new system
   - Test all major functions
   - Create backup of migrated data

### Data Validation Per Branch
```
Branch Validation Checklist:
□ Customer count matches legacy
□ Transaction totals match legacy reports
□ Vehicle registrations complete
□ Recovery statements accurate
□ Date ranges preserved
□ No data corruption detected
```
